Running, it's not everyone's cup of tea, but the health benefits are undeniable if approached sensibly. So let's take a little look at how to ease into running.

Firstly, it should be said that launching into an intensive running program after not having done much running - or other exercise for that matter - is probably unwise and often leads to some form of injury, preventing you from running which totally defeats the purpose. Hence the ***ease*** into running.

(Also, there are plenty of in depth articles about how to get into running out there (like [this one](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/beginners/a772727/how-to-start-running-today/)), this blog doesn't claim to be one of them. I do, however, hope this short piece gives you a few pointers and inspires you to investigate further and put your left foot in front of your right ...

Why run?

It's hard. You're out in the weather. It can be uncomfortable.

But still, so many people love it. Why?

This [short film clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbMZC7YiXR8) is worth watching for many many reasons, not least of which because it asks this very question to people who run at this iconic running location. It's shows something of the very varied and very human side to running.

Spending time thinking about why and what you'd like to get out of running is useful, especially when the we start coming up with excuses not to go running. Having a clear reason helps keep you on track and motivated.

Common reasons to run include:

- it's good for me

- it's freeing

- I got a place in the marathon

- my partner runs and I want to share it with them

- I like buying shoes and new stuff like a new watch

- to prove I can

- adventure

- stress relief

- to get to and escape from the office

Ultimately people are either running *away* from something or running *to* something.

Each to their own I say - whatever gets you out there.

OK, so you've decided to do this. What's next? Start. Sounds obvious, but it's often the hardest hurdle to get over. By start, I mean do something - like going for a 15 minute **walk**.

The goal here is to just get used to doing something regularly and walking is probably the easiest thing to start with. It also allows you to figure out a few other thing while you get going, like shoes and stuff.

Find some shoes. You most likely already have a pair of "sports shoes". Find them. Dust them off (or don't, makes them look more used than perhaps they are?!) and put them somewhere you can see them, like at the front door. Next find some clothes to wear - this will become your "sports kit". Congrats, you're doing great.

Now set an alarm for 30mins earlier than you would normally get up.This is your new getting up time. It's your new special time - it's all yours. It's special.

The trick. The trick is to set things up so it's "easy" for you to pull off this new running thing. So here's what you're going to do.The night before your first special day you're going set up your sport kit somewhere you can easily and quietly change into. Set your shoes by the door. Set your alarm to your new special time. Then when you wake up everything is all set - no thinking required. Just swing your legs out of bed. Put your feet on the floor. Stand up. Get changed. Put on your shoes. Grab your keys. And walk in one direction for 7 & 1/2 mins. Notice who else is up and about. Notice the sounds.Notice the smells.Notice the light or dark.Breath it in. Turn around and go home. Done.

Congratulations - you've started your journey to become a runner!

Do this for a few weeks. Get used to the habit or *build* the habit.

During this time you're getting used to the shoes, socks, track pants, t-shirt, jacket etc, trying new bits of kit and learning more about what feels good for you.

You're also "earning the right" to a new pair of shoes (should you need them) and you know you'll actually use them.

Once this has become a habit and you're ready to take the next step (literally) to running I recommend reading the [Runners World article](https://www.runnersworld.com/uk/training/beginners/a772727/how-to-start-running-today/) about starting to run as they outline a great schedule to move thing along.

Like all exercise running is easier and more efficient if your body is moving well. Checking in with your health practictioner is a great way to help ensure you're moving well. 

Lastly, getting good at running takes time.  Our cardiovascular system adapts more quickly to training than our joints ligaments and conceive tissue. It takes years for these tissues to adapt to the genuine stressors of running. This is why *professional* runners build up to a marathon distance over a period of years, not months. I say this because I've seen countless people get a place in a marathon and think they can be *ready* for it in 6 months only to breakdown during the training program be a mess after the event or, worse still, not enjoy the experience of the actual marathon itself.

Running is a journey - in more ways than one - and I encourage you to give yourself time and permission to enjoy all of them, because, in the long run you're running for you.
